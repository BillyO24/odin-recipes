                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil. Add the chicken and cook until cooked through, about 7-8 minutes.</li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, make the sauce. In a bowl, whisk together remaining soy sauce, hoisin sauce, chili garlic sauce, sugar, chicken stock, ginger, and cornstarch.</li>
                <li>Add the sauce to the chicken and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue to cook and stir often to coat the chicken with the sauce. As the sauce thickens, it will coat the chicken even more. Fold in cashews.</li>
