        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Butter (cold, cut into cubes)</li>
            <li>1 cup Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Sugar</li>
            <li>2 large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract (optional)</li>
            <li>3 cups Flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Cornstarch</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 cup Chocolate Chips</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup Peanut Butter Cups (chopped)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Add in eggs and vanilla and mix for 1 minute longer.</li>
                <li>Fold in flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Add chocolate chips and a heaping 1 cup of peanut butter cups, reserving about 1/3 cup for the top of the cookies.</li>
                <li>Roll into 4 to 6-ounce balls. If making 4-ounce balls, you should end up with about 12-13 cookies or if you roll into 6-ounce balls, you should end up with 8-9 cookies.</li>
                <li>Place on a parchment paper lined, light-colored baking sheet. Bake for 9-12 minutes. Do not overbake as these cookies are supposed to be slightly soft in the center. As soon as you remove the baking sheet from the oven, carefully place the extra peanut butter cups on top of the cookies. Allow to set up for 10 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
